Ultima Online bot and useful snippets.

If my memory serves, I started playing UO around 2002-2003, and played
on and off during the years. To this day it remains my favourite game even
if it's been many years since I played. Posting mostly because of nostalgia.

I made some OpenEUO scripts such as:
* an autolooter that collects various types of items and gold. Looting is hard
because you have to be careful about distance from the container, targeting,
items you don't care about, race conditions due to lag.
* an auto healer, supporting multiple types of heals, such as bandages and 
potions. It was interesting to do, because you have to track both your
character state and stats. (For example you don't want to heal while you are
hidden, because it reveals you. Also you don't want to heal while poisoned,
you should drink the antidote first); the game journal; targeting timeouts.
* some skill development helpers for extremely repeatable actions
* skinning and cutting hides from eg. cows and dragons
* using potions to counter negative effects, such as running out of stamina,
losing agility, losing strength
* auto opening of doors
* auto attacker of enemy NPCs. Useful in combination with the autolooter for
that semi-afk gold gathering
* keeping track of durability of equipment
* doom boss fight helper for cutting bones. You have to cut them, otherwise
they spawn more mobs
* searching for "perfect pieces" of armor, useful for crafting
